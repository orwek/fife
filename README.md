The Free Interactive Fiction Engine (fife) is a JavaScript engine for creating and playing interactive fiction in the browser.

Purpose/Goal
---
To make interactive fiction easier to write and more accessible on the web. This is done by creating a user interface that is mobile friendly and utilizes JavaScript as the language of the interpreter. Stories can then be written in JSON format using a predefined structure that the interpreter understands. The end result will be introducing interactive fiction to a new generation that uses mobile devices as their primary form of entertainment.
